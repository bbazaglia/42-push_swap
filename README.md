## ðŸ’¡ About the project

This project involves sorting data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, and the smallest number of moves.

I've written an article that provides detailed guidance on developing this project, placing special emphasis on understanding how doubly linked lists work and how to properly visualize them.

You can access it on [Medium](https://medium.com/@beatrizbazaglia/push-swap-3390f2b33428).


## ðŸ“‹ Testing

To compile, go to the project path and run:

```shell
$ make 
```

Then, execute the program.

```shell
$ ./push_swap [numbers to be sorted] 
```

Disclaimer: The main purpose of this repository is to expose my code and help other students to understand what was done in each function. Therefore, this work should be used for academic reasons, by those who aim to learn, and not merely copy.
